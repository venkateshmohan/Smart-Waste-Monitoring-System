# Smart-Waste-Monitoring-System

Objective is to establish smart management and monitoring system of waste.
This project would provide a much more enhanced waste management solution for the optimization of conventional waste collection system.
This reduces the contamination of waste due to time consumption and complex traditional system which are toxic in nature.

Purpose:
    To make the environment clean by avoiding the overflow of dustbins.
    To implement intelligent positioning of dustbins.
    To provide dynamic routing for corporation trucks.

Problem Statement: 
The day-by-day problems faced by the corporation, is in regular monitoring and management of waste.
The conventional waste collection systems are difficult to maintain since operation and maintenance costs are high.
It is also a burden for the corporation truck drivers to do a periodic check up of fill level of dustbins. 
Due to the overflow of waste near the dustbins, people are prone to various diseases.
We believe our project will be a solution in overcoming these problems. 


Methodology:
The main concept behind this project is to provide communication within smart space which comprises dustbins, base station , corporation trucks.
The real time information of capacity of wastes are monitored by keeping  a proximity sensor below the lid of the dustbin.
The weight of waste generated are monitored by weight sensors and vacuum space in the dustbin is identified by it which goes undetected by proximity sensor. 

Furthermore, it is also important to determine the position of the dustbin.
The Wi-Fi shield enabled Raspberry pi b+ collects, processes and transmits information about the waste level of dustbin to the base station.
This data provides real time information on fill-level of dustbin whether they are empty or not.
